Sets the due date (the date when the card appears again in your review queue) of cards after answering it correcty to the lowest due date of any sibling card (card with same note).

Example:
You have 2 Cards of the same Note: "Japanese -> English" and "English -> Japanese"
You answer the first correctly and Anki sets the due date to 10 days.
You answer the second incorrectly and Anki sets the due date to tomorrow.
After that, this Addon sets the due date of the first Card to tomorrow too.
